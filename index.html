                    <h2>What is FOSS?</h2>
                    <p>Free and open-source software (FOSS) is a term used to refer to groups of software consisting of 
                        both free software and open-source software[a] where anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, 
                        study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people 
                        are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software.[3] This is in contrast to 
                        proprietary software, where the software is under restrictive copyright licensing and the source 
                        code is usually hidden from the users.

                        Users of FOSS benefit from the Four Essential Freedoms to make unrestricted use of,
                        and to study, copy, modify, and redistribute such software with or without modification. 
                        If they would like to change the functionality of software they can bring about changes
                        to the code and, if they wish, distribute such modified versions of the software or often 
                        − depending on the software's decision making model and its other users 
                        − even push or request such changes to be made via updates to the original software.</p>

                    <h2>History of its development.</h2>
                    <p>In the 1950s and 1960s, computer operating software and compilers were delivered as a part of hardware
                    purchases without separate fees. At the time, source code, the human-readable form of software, was generally 
                    distributed with the software providing the ability to fix bugs or add new functions.[1] Universities were 
                    early adopters of computing technology. Many of the modifications developed by universities were openly 
                    shared, in keeping with the academic principles of sharing knowledge, and organizations sprung up to facilitate
                    sharing. As large-scale operating systems matured, fewer organizations allowed modifications to the operating
                    software, and eventually such operating systems were closed to modification. However, utilities and other
                    added-function applications are still shared and new organizations have been formed to promote the sharing of
                     software.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <h4>Free software before the 1980s</h4>
                    <p>In the 1950s and into the 1960s almost all software was produced by academics and corporate 
                    researchers working in collaboration,[3] often shared as public-domain software. As such, it 
                    was generally distributed under the principles of openness and cooperation long established in 
                    the fields of academia, and was not seen as a commodity in itself. Such communal behavior later 
                    became a central element of the so-called hacking culture (a term with a positive connotation 
                    among open-source programmers). At this time, source code, the human-readable form of software, 
                    was generally distributed with the software machine code because users frequently modified the 
                    software themselves, because it would not run on different hardware or OS without modification, 
                    and also to fix bugs or add new functions.[4][5][failed verification] The first example of free 
                    and open-source software is believed to be the A-2 system, developed at the UNIVAC division of 
                    Remington Rand in 1953,[6] which was released to customers with its source code. They were 
                    invited to send their improvements back to UNIVAC.[7] Later, almost all IBM mainframe software 
                    was also distributed with source code included. User groups such as that of the IBM 701, 
                    called SHARE, and that of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), called DECUS, were formed to 
                    facilitate the exchange of software. The SHARE Operating System, originally developed by General
                    Motors, was distributed by SHARE for the IBM 709 and 7090 computers. Some university computer 
                    labs even had a policy requiring that all programs installed on the computer had to come with 
                    published source-code files.[8]

                    In 1969 the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), a transcontinental, 
                    high-speed computer network was constructed. The network (later succeeded by the Internet) 
                    simplified the exchange of software code.</p>
