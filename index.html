            <h2>What is FOSS?</h2>
            <p>The Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) model provides interesting tools and processes with which women and men can create, exchange, share and exploit software and knowledge efficiently and effectively. 
            FOSS can play an important role as a practical instrument for development as its free and open aspirations make it a natural component of development efforts in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
