                    <p>Free and open-source software (FOSS) allows users and programmers to edit, modify or reuse the software's source code. This gives developers the opportunity to improve program functionality by modifying it.

                        enabling easy software development from expert developers collaborating worldwide without any need for reverse engineering.
